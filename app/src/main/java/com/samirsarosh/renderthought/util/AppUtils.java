Certainly — here’s a clear and concise version you can include under a “Proposal” or “Rationale” section of your RFC:


---

✅ Proposal: Two-Strategy Spring Animator

We propose implementing a unified SpringLikeAnimator that internally switches between two strategies based on the configuration:


---

🔀 Why Two Strategies?

✅ To support gesture-driven, physics-accurate animations (using stiffness, damping, velocity).

✅ To support timed, sequenced animations that play well with AnimatorSet-style flows (via duration).

✅ To maintain backward compatibility with existing Animator infrastructure (like Bloks or Jetpack).

✅ To provide developer flexibility in a single API: config drives behavior.

✅ To match behavior of React Native Reanimated v3 and Framer Motion, which switch spring behavior based on duration.

🤖 Strategy Switching Logic

If duration is provided → use InterpolatedSpringStrategy
(Backed by ValueAnimator + springy interpolator. Deterministic and composable.)

If duration is not provided → use PhysicsSpringStrategy
(Backed by SpringAnimation. Physics-driven and responsive.)

This design offers the flexibility of modern UX while ensuring technical integration with existing animation pipelines. Let me know if you'd like a diagram version of this too.
